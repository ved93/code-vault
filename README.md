If you work in data science then you must be using same codes in multiple projects. Then its better to save your regularly used snippets. There are multiple different tools to manage and save code snippets which I found confusing. You should be careful to include new tool in your arsenal. Github is one of the best tool you have. 

The structure:
1. Pandas Code snippets
2. Numpy Code snippets
3. Visualisation snippets
4. Sklearn snippets

Most often you will use pandas. 90% my use-cases are solved from this pandas file. Now I hardly check stackoverflow or pandas documentation for my tasks.
